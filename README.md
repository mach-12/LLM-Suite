# LLM-Suite
llm-suite is a dynamic security automation software tailored for Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to fortify LLMs against potential vulnerabilities and security threats. The software encompasses dynamic application security testing and a security SDK. 

It addresses key issues outlined in the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications focusing on aspects like prompt injection, insecure output handling, training data poisoning, supply chain vulnerabilities, sensitive information disclosure, insecure plugin design and excessive agency.
Ongoing development and testing will further refine the software's efficacy in securing LLMs against emerging threats.
